This Folder contain All examples using transmart

Since we need to use the OpenAI API key, we need to load it into the environment variable.

Run in root of the transmart project

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Please enter your API key and API proxy URL (the latter is optional).

```sh
source .env
```
